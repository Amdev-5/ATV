### Analytics Components Reasoning

1. **Defect Analysis Visualizations**
   - Bar plots: Quick comparison across systems
   - Heatmaps: Identify defect concentration areas
   - Radar charts: Multi-dimensional system analysis
   - Reason: Enable pattern recognition and trend analysis

2. **Maintenance Optimization**
   - Clustering: Group similar maintenance needs
   - Priority scoring: Risk-based scheduling
   - Timeline visualization: Resource allocation
   - Reason: Optimize maintenance efficiency and resource utilization

3. **Spare Parts Forecasting**
   - Time series analysis: Identify seasonal patterns
   - Machine learning: Predict future demand
   - Stock optimization: Minimize inventory costs
   - Reason: Ensure parts availability while optimizing inventory

### Decision Support Logic

1. **Maintenance Priority Score**
   ```python
   priority_score = (
       0.4 * normalized_fault_count +
       0.3 * normalized_age +
       0.3 * critical_system_weight
   )
   ```
   Reasoning:
   - Fault count: Primary indicator of vehicle health
   - Age: Historical maintenance predictor
   - Critical systems: Mission impact consideration

2. **Stock Level Optimization**
   ```python
   recommended_stock = (
       average_demand * lead_time_factor +
       safety_stock_margin
   )
   ```
   Reasoning:
   - Demand patterns: Historical consumption
   - Lead time: Supply chain considerations
   - Safety margin: Risk mitigation

### Integration Points

1. **Data Flow**
   ```
   Raw Data → Validation → Processing → Analytics → Visualization
   ```

2. **AI Integration**
   ```
   User Query → Context Enrichment → Knowledge Base → Response Generation
   ```

3. **Decision Flow**
   ```
   Data Analysis → Risk Assessment → Priority Calculation → Recommendation
   ```
